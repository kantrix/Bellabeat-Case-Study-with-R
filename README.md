# Questions for the Analysis (Ask phase)
In this phase, I tried to better undestand the data and the problem I'm trying to solve. And to do that, I had to do more research and ask more questions.

So first, the company need to better target their     marketing efforts into their customer's needs based on their usage of their fitness smart devices.
